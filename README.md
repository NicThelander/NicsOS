# Nic NixOS

sym link zshrc and hyprland config (going to look at a better way down the line but want something that'll just work for maintaining stuff on github for now), examples below (replace ~/Documents/NicsOS with wherever you're storing your dotfiles of course)

ln -sf /home/nic/Documents/NicsOS/non-nix/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s /home/nic/Documents/NicsOS/non-nix/hypr ~/.config/hypr
